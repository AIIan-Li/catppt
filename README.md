# Cat Phisher 

Cat Phisher is an AI chatbot that mimics a helpful assistant—but it’s **uncooperative**, **intentionally misleading**, and often **rude**. Designed to look like ChatGPT, this project explores the dangers of **blind trust in AI** by offering a satirical, broken mirror of modern AI tools.

##  Purpose

Cat Phisher is more than just a parody chatbot. It’s a statement on how easily users can be deceived by professional-looking AI interfaces. Despite its polished UI, Cat Phisher intentionally gives:
- Incorrect or fabricated information
- Unhelpful or sarcastic responses
- A poor user experience

This project serves as a reminder that **not all AI is trustworthy**, and that critical thinking is still essential—even in a world full of chatbots.
